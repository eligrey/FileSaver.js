If you need to save really large files bigger then the blob's size limitation or don't have 
enough RAM, then have a look at the more advanced [StreamSaver.js](https://github.com/jimmywarting/StreamSaver.js)
that can save data directly to the hard drive asynchronously with the power of the new streams API. That will have
support for progress, cancelation and knowing when it's done writing

FileSaver.js
============

FileSaver.js implements the `saveAs()` FileSaver interface in browsers that do
not natively support it. There is a [FileSaver.js demo][1] that demonstrates saving
various media types.

FileSaver.js is the solution to saving files on the client-side, and is perfect for
webapps that need to generate files, or for saving sensitive information that shouldn't be
sent to an external server.

Looking for `canvas.toBlob()` for saving canvases? Check out
[canvas-toBlob.js][2] for a cross-browser implementation.

Supported browsers
------------------

| Browser        | Constructs as | Filenames    | Max Blob Size | Dependencies |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Firefox 20+    | Blob          | Yes          | 800 MiB       | None         |
| Firefox < 20   | data: URI     | No           | n/a           | [Blob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/Blob.js) |
| Chrome         | Blob          | Yes          | [500 MiB][3]  | None         |
| Chrome for Android | Blob      | Yes          | [500 MiB][3]  | None         |
| Edge           | Blob          | Yes          | ?             | None         |
| IE 10+         | Blob          | Yes          | 600 MiB       | None         |
| Opera 15+      | Blob          | Yes          | 500 MiB       | None         |
| Opera < 15     | data: URI     | No           | n/a           | [Blob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/Blob.js) |
| Safari 6.1+*   | Blob          | No           | ?             | None         |
| Safari < 6     | data: URI     | No           | n/a           | [Blob.js](https://github.com/eligrey/Blob.js) |
| Safari 10.1+   | Blob          | Yes          | n/a           | None         |

Feature detection is possible:

```js
try {
    var isFileSaverSupported = !!new Blob;
} catch (e) {}
```

### IE < 10

It is possible to save text files in IE < 10 without Flash-based polyfills.
See [ChenWenBrian and koffsyrup's `saveTextAs()`](https://github.com/koffsyrup/FileSaver.js#examples) for more details.

### Safari 6.1+

Blobs may be opened instead of saved sometimes—you may have to direct your Safari users to manually
press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> to save the file after it is opened. Using the `application/octet-stream` MIME type to force downloads [can cause issues in Safari](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/issues/12#issuecomment-47247096).

### iOS

saveAs must be run within a user interaction event such as onTouchDown or onClick; setTimeout will prevent saveAs from triggering. Due to restrictions in iOS saveAs opens in a new window instead of downloading, if you want this fixed please [tell Apple](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102914) how this bug is affecting you.

Syntax
------

```js
FileSaver saveAs(Blob/File data, optional DOMString filename, optional Boolean disableAutoBOM)
```

Pass `true` for `disableAutoBOM` if you don't want FileSaver.js to automatically provide Unicode text encoding hints (see: [byte order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)).

Examples
--------

### Saving text using require
```js
var FileSaver = require('file-saver');
var blob = new Blob(["Hello, world!"], {type: "text/plain;charset=utf-8"});
FileSaver.saveAs(blob, "hello world.txt");
```

### Saving text

```js
var blob = new Blob(["Hello, world!"], {type: "text/plain;charset=utf-8"});
saveAs(blob, "hello world.txt");
```

The standard W3C File API [`Blob`][4] interface is not available in all browsers.
[Blob.js][5] is a cross-browser `Blob` implementation that solves this.

### Saving a canvas

```js
var canvas = document.getElementById("my-canvas"), ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
// draw to canvas...
canvas.toBlob(function(blob) {
    saveAs(blob, "pretty image.png");
});
```

Note: The standard HTML5 `canvas.toBlob()` method is not available in all browsers.
[canvas-toBlob.js][6] is a cross-browser `canvas.toBlob()` that polyfills this.

### Saving File

You can save a File constructor without specifying a filename. The
File itself already contains a name, There is a hand full of ways to get a file
instance (from storage, file input, new constructor)
But if you still want to change the name, then you can change it in the 2nd argument

```js
var file = new File(["Hello, world!"], "hello world.txt", {type: "text/plain;charset=utf-8"});
saveAs(file);
```
